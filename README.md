# Level 1: Capstone project 2

This application uses a python gaming library called **Pygame** to assist in creating a simple game for users to enjoy.

The player will have to move their character around the screen to avoid the enemy characters. The enemy characters will be moving in different directions to *‘attack’* the user player. If the player manages to collect the *‘token’* or avoid all the enemies, they will win the game.
